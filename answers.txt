Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Using Git allows people to work on code collaboratively with it's branch features. Additionally, you can experiment and mess around with the code without making changes to the main version. You can also keep track of version control, going back in time to see edits and restore any versions. It is also the industry standard to use Git.
